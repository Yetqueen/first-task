Foods such as sugar and bread that contain these substances can also be referred to as carbohydrates.
Food is made up of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. ... carbohydrates such as bread, pasta or chips. <br>
Carbohydrates are the main source of energy for the body. They are the sugars, starches, and dietary fiber that occur in plant foods and dairy products.
Carbohydrates are mainly found in plant foods. They also occur in dairy products in the form of a milk sugar called lactose. <br>
<h2>EXAMPLES:</h2> Rice <br> Yam <br> Breads <br> Pastas <br> Grains <br> Snacks Food........<br>
</p>
<p>
<h1 class="pro"> PROTEINS:</h1> PROTEINS is a nutrient found in food (as meat, milk, eggs, and beans) that is made up of many amino acids joined together, is a necessary part of the diet, and is essential for normal cell structure and function. protein. noun, often attributive. <br>
A protein is a naturally occurring, extremely complex substance that consists of amino acid residues joined by peptide bonds. Proteins are present in all living organisms and include many essential biological compounds such as enzymes, hormones, and antibodies. <br>
<h2>EXAMPLES:</h2> Beans <br> Fish <br> Milk <br> Meat <br> Eggs <br> Plantain <br> Sea foods.......<br>  
</p>
<p>
<h1>FAT AND OIL:</h1> FAT AND OIL are liquid at room temperature, like vegetable oils used in cooking. They come from many different plants and from fish. Oils are not a food group, but they provide you with important nutrients such as unsaturated fats and vitamin E. <br>
Examples are: Butter, ghee, lard, suet, goose fat, hard margarines, coconut oil and palm oil.<br>

<p>
<h1>VITAMINS:</h1> VITAMINS are substances that our bodies need to develop and function normally. They include vitamins A, C, D, E, and K, choline, and the B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, biotin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folate/folic acid) <br>
Vitamins are organic substances that are generally classified as either fat soluble or water soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K) dissolve in fat and tend to accumulate in the body.
</p>
<p><h1>MINERALS</h1> MINERALS are those elements on the earth and in foods that our bodies need to develop and function normally.

<h3>Examples includes</h3>  Shellfish <br> Cruciferous vegetables <br> Organ meats <br> Cocoa <br> Avocados etc..... <br>

<p>
<h1>WATER:</h1> Nutrients are grouped into macronutrients and micronutrients. Carbohydrates, proteins, fats and water are macronutrients, and vitamins and minerals are micronutrients. <br>
Water is a nutrient in food groups: grains, meats, dairy products, fruits, and vegetables. Major nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, water-soluble vitamins, and minerals are hydrophilic. Most of carbohydrates and proteins in foods are plasticized by water.
